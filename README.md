# JackKnife
JackKnife is a Network Defense Tool Repository for Powershell. It is made up of one main script and multiple modules built within. JackKnife is currently in development and new material will be added when updated. Works on Powershell 3.0 and up. The idea and point of JackKnife is to have a huge repository of Network and Host analytical tools in one script and in one source of access. JackKnife is currently in the process of its WINRM Module.
